# Canvas Game Classic

Canvas Game Classic is a fast-paced arcade-style game built with pure JavaScript and the HTML5 Canvas API. Inspired by the classic Snake game, it introduces a fresh twist: instead of growing, your goal is to survive the longest while eating the most food. Each time you eat, the board grows, the level increases, the speed ramps up â€” and so does the challenge.
